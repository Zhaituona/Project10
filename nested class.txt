nested class design a class inside a class

 what is the nested class for , we create a class then under this class we create two or three or multiple classes,
this called nested class , is this logically make sense , also can easy to group , like payment system , we have payment system 
as a outer class ,but we also can have different payment options , like creditcard , paypal , debit ,check ..so they can take all
to the payment system but can have private method . I think in the jdk 10 , if we created one outer class then let this outer class
have two inner class , usually we set the second innerclass method as a private.jdk 10 defalut second class method as private, so we 
cannot able to access the second innercalss method .

if we set the second innerclass , as a static then have static method, then from the outer class we can direct call the second innerclass
can use that static method without creating an object.

Enum 
is contain constant of data . maybe year 12months, day 24hours , week 7days, hour 60mintues.like this are constant variable.
